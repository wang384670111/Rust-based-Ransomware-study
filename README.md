# Rust-based Ransomware

**Note: These samples were gathered solely to support academic research. Permission to use this dataset for any other purposes must be obtained from the authors.**

## Introduction

We construct 1,434 active Rust-based samples spanning 12 families. The top six families are BlackCat (36.89%), Hive (29. 08%), Qilin (12. 34%), Luna (9.97%), Akira (5.72%) and RansomEXX (2.51%). Samples were collected from February 2024 through October 2025, and the dataset continues to expand as new Rust-based campaigns emerge.


Due to the large file size and bandwidth considerations, we upload a portion of the data for subsequent Rust-based ransomware research (712 samples from 12 ransomware families).


Additionally, we have encrypted and compressed the samples and set a unified access password of "infected" to enhance security during data storage.


## Access
Due to GitHub storage limitations, the dataset is available via Google Drive: [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1INV5eNtHPdKQlD9q8PIe7HOVlIECB0Uk?usp=drive_link). If you want to have complete dataset, please contact us.
